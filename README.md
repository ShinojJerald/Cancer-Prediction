# Cancer-Prediction

I have used cancer dataset in order to predict whether a patient is malignant or benign to cancer. I have used 33 features for prediction. I have used classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Kernel SVM,Naive Bayes,Decision Tree and Random Forest. And deep artificial neural network as deep learning algorithm and used k-fold cross validation and catboosting for model boosting.
